# Computational physics with Python

**Author:** Sebastian Montoya. 2023

This repository contains several Python scripts for various scientific and computational applications developed for the course "Computational Physics" at University of Antioquia in 2023. Each script has an execution file to run it and it's described below along with a brief overview of its purpose and functionality.

## 1. BallisticPendulum

The `BallisticPendulum` class simulates the behavior of a ballistic pendulum. It calculates the deflection angle and block-bullet velocity, and it can be used to analyze the motion of a pendulum system.

## 2. ChargedParticleField

The `ParticleMotion` class models the motion of charged particles in an electromagnetic field. It can simulate and visualize the trajectories of charged particles.

## 3. DataAnalysis

The `CSVPlotter` class is designed for data analysis. It includes methods for fitting data to quadratic and Gaussian functions and calculating the specific heat of a system.

## 4. EDO

The `ODESolver` class provides functionality for solving ordinary differential equations using both the Euler method and the `odeint` function from SciPy.

## 5. InteractionParticleMaterial

The `Particle` and `Material` classes simulate the interaction between particles and a material. It calculates energy losses and probabilities of those losses.

## 6. IsingModel

The `IsingModel` class models the Ising model for magnetic systems. It calculates the energy, magnetization, and specific heat of a magnetic system.

## 7. MontecarloApplication

The `DiceSystem` class models a dice rolling system with the option to roll dice consecutively or simultaneously.

## 8. MontecarloIntegration

The `MonteCarloIntegrator` class performs Monte Carlo integration to estimate definite integrals of functions. It also compares the Monte Carlo method with the `quad` function from SciPy.

## 9. Projectile_with_Wind

The `ProjectileMotionWithWind` class extends the `ProjectileMotion` class to model projectile motion in the presence of wind. It calculates the trajectory of a projectile with wind in the x-direction.

## 10. SimplePendulum

The `SimplePendulum` class models the motion of a simple pendulum. It provides methods to simulate pendulum motion using the Euler method and to solve the differential equation using `odeint`.

Each script includes comments and docstrings to explain its usage and functionality. To run any of these scripts, you can refer to the source code and example code provided.

Feel free to explore and utilize these scripts for your scientific and computational needs.
