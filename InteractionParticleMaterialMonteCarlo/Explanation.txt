Problem to apply Monte Carlo: Energy loss of a particle when passing through a medium.
Inspired by the Ising model problem, and starting from the fundamental idea of the Landau distribution model [1], it is proposed to apply Monte Carlo to simulate the evolution of the energy of a particle traveling through a discretized medium (cells), in which it can lose energy with different probabilities (due to collisions, radiation, random phenomena).
A random number can be generated to determine whether or not the particle loses energy in the cell. If it is decided that the particle loses energy, another random number can be generated to determine how much energy it loses. These processes are repeated for each cell that the particle passes through, and the energy lost in each cell is accumulated to obtain the energy distribution of the particle throughout the material.
Execution explanation:
In this example, the energy of a particle passing through a cell of material with a density of 1.0 g/cm3 and the following probabilities of energy loss are simulated: 0.1 MeV with a probability of 10%, 0.5 MeV with a probability of 40%, 1.0 MeV with a probability of 30%, and 5.0 MeV with a probability of 20%.
